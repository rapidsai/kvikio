/**
 * The {@code CuFileHandle} class is an abstract base class for managing cuFile
 * resource handles in the native library.
 * It represents a common mechanism for interacting with files via cuFile,
 * storing the native pointer to a resource and
 * ensuring that the resource is properly destroyed when no longer needed.
 * <p>
 * This class initializes the cuFile library on class loading and provides
 * methods for cleanup, specifically the
 * {@code close()} method to destroy the native resource pointer. Subclasses of
 * {@code CuFileHandle} should implement
 * specific functionality, such as reading or writing data, using this base
 * class to manage the native resource pointer.
