/**
 * @brief Handle of a memory-mapped file
 *
 * This utility class facilitates the use of file-backed memory by providing a performant method
 * `pread()` to read a range of data into user-provided memory residing on the host or device.
 *
 * File-backed memory can be considered when a large number of nonadjacent file ranges (specified by
 * the `offset` and `size` pair) are to be frequently accessed. It can potentially reduce memory
 * usage due to demand paging (compared to reading the entire file with `read(2)`), and may improve
 * I/O performance compared to frequent calls to `read(2)`.
