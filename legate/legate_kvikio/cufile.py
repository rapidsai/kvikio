        The file is opened in this constructor immediately and not in a
        Legate task. This means that re-opening a file that was created
        by a not-yet-executed Legate task requires a blocking fence like
        `get_legate_runtime().issue_execution_fence(block=True)`.

        Legate-KvikIO doesn't maintain a file descriptor thus the file path
        to the file must not change while opened by this handle.

        Parameters
        ----------
        file: pathlib.Path or str
            Path-like object giving the pathname (absolute or relative to the
            current working directory) of the file to be opened and registered.

        #   * create or truncate files opened in "w" mode, which is required
        #     because `TaskOpCode.WRITE` always opens the file in "r+" mode.
